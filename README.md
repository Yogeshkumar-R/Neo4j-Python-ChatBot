# Tutorial: Neo4j-Python-ChatBot

This project is a **Neo4j-Python-ChatBot** designed to build a *structured knowledge graph* from unstructured documents. It efficiently *ingests various file types* (like PDFs and Word documents), leverages *Large Language Models (LLMs)* to extract key entities and relationships from the text, and then stores this interconnected information within a **Neo4j graph database**. Users can then *visually explore* this knowledge graph, making complex data connections intuitive and easy to understand.
